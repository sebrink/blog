title_description: "My name is Scott Brink, also know as sandw1ch.   I am studying Computing Security at Rochester Institute of Technology.  I am the Tech Lead of <a href=\"http://ritsec.club\">RITSEC</a> and I was the captain of RIT's Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition this year.   My interests range all over the security field, however recently I have been enjoying penetration testing and experimenting with DevOps tools.   When I am not yelling at my computer, I enjoy swimming and rock climbing."
